# Write you a programming language

List of small programming languages that you can implement in a relatively small amount of time for educational purposes.

- [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) - Clojure inspired Lisp interpreter implemented in 82 languages (85 different implementations and 105 runtime modes)
- [The Programming Languages Zoo](https://plzoo.andrej.com/) is a collection of miniature programming languages which demonstrates various concepts and techniques used in programming language design and implementation
- [Write you a Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/). We will build a small functional language called Fun which is a partial Haskell 2010 toy language; complete with a parser, type inference, datatypes, pattern matching, desugaring, typeclasses, higher-kinded types, monadic IO, arbitrary-rank polymorphism, records, Core language, STG intermediate language, lazy evaluation, interpreter, native code generator, a runtime, and several optimization passes.
- [Duet](https://github.com/chrisdone/duet) - A tiny language, a subset of Haskell (with type classes) aimed at aiding teachers teach Haskell
  - https://github.com/Jaak/TinyOutsideIn
- [Implementing a JIT Compiled Language with Haskell and LLVM](https://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/). This tutorial runs through the implementation of a simple language, and the basics of how to build a compiler in Haskell, showing how fun and easy it can be
- [How to implement a programming language in JavaScript](http://lisperator.net/pltut/dream). This is a tutorial on how to implement a programming language. If you ever wrote an interpreter or a compiler, then there is probably nothing new for you here. But, if you're using regexps to “parse” anything that looks like a programming language, then please read at least the section on parsing.
- [Monkey](https://github.com/prologic/monkey-lang) programming language interpreter designed in "Writing An Interpreter In Go". A step-by-step walk-through where each commit is a fully working part
- [Create Your Own Programming Language with Rust](https://createlang.rs/intro.html). This book arises from my frustration of not finding modern, clear and concise teaching materials that are readily accessible to beginners like me who wants to learn a bit on how to create their own programming language.
- [Crafting interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html). This is a book on implementing interpreters for programming languages.
  - [Dictu](https://github.com/dictu-lang/Dictu)
- [Cubiml](https://github.com/Storyyeller/cubiml-demo) is a simple ML-like programming language with subtyping and full type inference. You can try it out online in your browser here. Cubiml is not intended to be used in its own right, but rather to serve as a tutorial for implementing cubic biunification, and therefore has a deliberately minimal feature set.
- [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours.pdf). An Introduction to Haskell through Example
  - [zepto](https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto)
- [Bril: A Compiler Intermediate Representation for Learning](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril)
